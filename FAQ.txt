FAQ

----------------------------------------------------------------

Q:	How do you enable the spectator HUD?
A:	Tick "Use adv. spectator HUD" in the advanced options menu.

Q:	How do I get a specific scoreboard size?
A:	Scoreboards toggle with hud_minmode. 
	If you want the game to launch with the 16vs16 scoreboard make sure that your game launches without minimnal HUD enabled.

Q:	My net_graph is clipping with the scoreboard. Help!
A:	That is not a question, damnit! You can use "net_graphpos (1-3)" to have the netgraph on the left side. 
	The command "net_graphproportionalfont 0" will make the text smaller for the netgraph.
	
Q:	Can you add <insert feature> to the HUD?
A:	Maybe. Open an issue on GitHub so that I can see track your suggestions. (github.com/whayay/yA_HUD/issues)

Q:	I've found a bug. How do I let you know?
A:	Same as above, use the GitHub issue tracker to let me know.

Q:	Can I use this on my Mac?
A: The most recent update seems to be broken entirely on Mac OS. You can use some of the older commits (you can still download those). Otherwise I'd recommend omphud and rayshud, they both support Mac OS.

Q:	Is the version I have up to date?
A:	If you just downloaded, yes. GitHub will sync all the changes I make. 
	You can track the commit history to see what happened since you downloaded the HUD. 
	(https://github.com/whayay/yA_HUD/commits/master)
	You can download older versions there as well.
	
Q:	I used one of the custom options, but now everything is weird!
A:	Make sure that you renamed/removed the original file before replacing it with the alternative file.
	Look for any odd character in the replacement files (watch out for spaces or "-" being left over).
	Please double-check the instructions before contacting me.

Q:	How can I import HUD crosshairs?
A:	Check out Ray's guide: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19762650/importingxhairstf2.jpg
	Or watch this video by Rays: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPH6On2F0Pw

Q:	I changed some colors in the clientscheme and nothing has changed!
A:	You need to restart the game for any changes to take effect. 
	Make sure that you didn't accidentally delete quotation marks.

Q: My health stays red even though I have full health! Is this a bug?
A: Yes, but it's on valve's end. You will experience this with pretty much every hud.
	You can use the command "hud_reloadscheme" to get rid of it.
	
Q: The vaccinator HUD is not showing certain icons! Can you add those icons?
A: Their position is broken on valve's end. The same thing applies for the status effects, which is why they are missing from the center version with HP cross.

Q: My unique items are gray-ish white. Is this a bug?
A: No, I changed some item colors a while ago (strange & unique colors)

Some useful CONSOLE COMMANDS:

"cl_spec_carrieditems 0" to get rid of the inspect panel while spectating

"hud_combattext 1" to show damage on hit

"toggle cl_hud_minmode" does the same as the scoreboard button, toggling the scoreboards
		(Putting "cl_hud_minmode 1" into your autoexec will always make it launch with the alternative scoreboard)
		
"hud_reloadscheme" reloads the HUD and can help you get rid of certain glitches		
		
Some of these can be found in the adv. options, you can find various other hud options there as well.
