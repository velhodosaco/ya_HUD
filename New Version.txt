First a quick info/intro thingy:

This is pretty much a complete re-design of the HUD. I had the luxury of having Garm3n and Ell help me make this. Some of the new elements are pretty much straight from Garm3n's new HUD "REX" (it's an amazing HUD btw). 

This design is not final, but I will keep yA_HUD to a single version from now on. I will expand the options a bit again and I will try to make it as easy as possible to modify the HUD. The clientscheme is now the new home for a lot of the customization. You can make various elements visisble there.

Please provide feedback for this new version using the tf.tv thread, steam group or the GitHub issue tracker. 
I know that some changes might be a bit hard to get used to, but I believe that many changes I made are for the better.

The old version of the HUD should be usable for a while and you will be able to use some of the new stuff with your old version as well. I won't offer much support for the older versions. If you miss certain aspects let me know. However, please don't dismiss this re-design simply because it's different.

About some specific design choices:

Alignment of the HP/Ammo and their boxes.
    This creates a stronger visual effect for being "low", since there will be a bigger empty space in the red background.
    
Medic HUD
    The charge count panel on the right is smaller, the % sign disappears when have the uber ready to create space for the "100".
    The meter subtext changes from "UBER" to "UBER AVAILABLE" when you have the uber ready.
    I put a box over the vaccinator HUD in order to be able to use custom shadows for the %-label.
    
Top left corner
    The quake-like timer location allows for the font size to be bigger. This makes reading it easy and makes it work better for lower resolutions. 
    The top-left corner became a location for general game info with this re-design, including the CTF info, Arena player count, KOTH timers & MvM info. The small amount of space gained in the center can be used to see bombers and general action now. This change will probably take some time to get used to.
    Timer supports "tf_hud_show_servertimelimit 1" now.
    
Building Panel re-design.
    You can see more now, yay!
    
ChargeMeters
    Gives you more vision in the center. You can even disable the MeterText easily to be able to see even more.
    
Killfeed
    Deathnotices have no background by default now, which again makes it easier to see what's going on behind the text. The font is slightly larger to help make it easier to read. Colors are re-adjusted as well. You can enable a background for the killfeed in the clientscheme.
    
Info for various game modes

    CTF interface now includes the "Playing to X" info. 
    Visuals for the ctf pointers are a bit cleaner as well.
